We first have to turn our application into a module.

Modules are a way of organizing JavaScript applications into self-contained components that can be combined in new and interesting ways. Angular relies on this technique for code isolation and requires that your application follows it before you can create a filter. There are only two things that you need to do to turn your app into a module:

Use the angular.module("name",[]) function call in your JS. This will instantiate and return a new module;
Pass the name of the module as the value of the ng-app directive.
Creating a filter then is as simple as calling the filter() method on the module object returned by angular.module("name", []).

Filters follow the Angular.js philosophy â€“ every piece of code that you write should be self-contained, testable and reusable. You can use this filter in all your views and even combine it with others through chaining.
